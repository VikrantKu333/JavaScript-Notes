Regular Expression - 
    A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
Syntax -
    /pattern/modifiers;

Regular Expression Modifiers -
    Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive more global searches.
Modifier	    Description
i	            Perform case-insensitive matching	
g	            Perform a global match (find all matches rather than stopping after the first match)	
m	            Perform multiline matching

Regular Expression Patterns -
    Brackets are used to find a range of characters.
Expression	    Description
[abc]	        Find any of the characters between the brackets	
[0-9]	        Find any of the digits between the brackets	
(x|y)	        Find any of the alternatives separated with |

    Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning.
Metacharacter	    Description
\d	                Find a digit	
\s	                Find a whitespace character	
\b	                Find a match at the beginning of a word like this: \bWORD, or at the end of a word like this: WORD\b	
\uxxxx	            Find the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx

    Quantifiers define quantities.
Quantifier	    Description
n+	            Matches any string that contains at least one n
n*	            Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
n?	            Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n
